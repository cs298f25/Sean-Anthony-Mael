# Deploy Processes

We will be using AWS to deploy our project onto a server and will also be deploying locally to our machine. We are going to implement a CI/CD pipeline (on manual trigger) to make a clean, easy, and efficient integration and deployment processes to our project while it's running so we do not have to tear it down for each update.
