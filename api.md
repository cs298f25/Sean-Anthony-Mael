# API Specifications

This project will utilize several different API's, such as a weather API and a music API.

- **Weather API:** This will be utilized to receive current updates about the weather, which will give the foundation of how the project will work. 
- **Music API:** This will be utilized to create playlists and play music depending on the current weather from the weather API.
- **Google Maps API** This will be utilized to recieve the current longitude and latitude of the user so that the weather api can update depending on the location of the user. 

Both API's will be used in tandem with each other to accomplish the goal of displaying weather information, and based on that info, curating music based on that weather, such as happy and upbeat music for sunny weather or slower music for rainy weather.
