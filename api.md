<h1> API Specifications

<h4> This project will utilize several different API's, such as a weather API and a music API.

- Weather API: This will be utilized in order to recieve current updates about the weather, that will give the foundation of how the project will work. 
- Music API: This will be utilized to create playlists and play music depending on the current weather from the weather API.

Both API's will be used in tandem with each other to accomplish the goal of displaying weather information, and based on that info, curating music based on that weather, such as happy and upbeat music for sunny weather or slower music for rainy weather.
