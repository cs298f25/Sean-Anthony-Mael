# Developmental Processes

To ensure a healthy git flow + communication there are a few principles we will ensure to keep a smooth git flow throughout the duration of the project:

- Each member is expected to pull from the repository they are working on before making changes

- Each member is expected push when finished and push on their corresponding branch

- There will be different branches for the different aspects of the project so it does not interfere with main. Main is going to be the reference to the point of where were officially at in the project with all features/changes merged from branches into main.
